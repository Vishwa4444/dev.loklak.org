This folder contains various indicies from various documentation site.
Indicies are responsible to generate TOC so they have to be in rST format.

Please make sure the filenames are in this format:
<PRIORITY>_<REPOSITORY_NAME>_<CONTENT>.rst

PRIORITY should be a two digit number, like 01, 02, 03, etc.
CONTENT should describe the content of the file, like "readme", "toc", etc.

The indicies compiler compiles ascending based on the filename.
